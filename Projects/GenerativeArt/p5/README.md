Stars is my attempt at generative art. I first tried to use JSON to track various planets, stars, and satellites in reference to Earth, but I could not find any JSON data to use. I instead turned to generative art where it uses math. 
I had inspiration from a Russian artist, whose name I unfortunately forgot. 
I found equations of a simple spiral to represent a galaxy. Then using help from The Coding Train, I was able to make it interactive with createVector(), and the other functions that go along with it. From there, I used keyIsPressed() to change numbers in the equation to make it more interactive. I thought about adding transparency to the background to have the stars leave trails, but it made the HTML really slow and took away the astethic.
