## How to Play

Use your mouse to avoid the incoming red balls. Stay away from the left and right borders, or it'll be game over!

The score is represented as "TIME" to show how long you've survived the endless onslaught.

It gets a little intense so be ready! Refresh the page to try again.

Good luck! Have fun!
