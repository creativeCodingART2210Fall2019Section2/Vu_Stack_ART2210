### Artist Statement


I see my self-portrait as largely unfinished; composed just with different fragments that make up who I am. 

For my abstract self-portrait I was initially influenced by the principles of the Bauhaus. Their process of breaking objects down into their simplest geometries helped me decide where I wanted to begin. Building upon this idea, a couple artists came to mind. 
Ryan Hewett's modern cubism style uses the literal human figure, and fills it with abstract elements, much like our thoughts and experiences; things that make us who we are. The way that Christa Rijneveld fills the canvas with the scenery and stillness around her inspired me to use the mountains as a metaphor for my inner journey of self-exploration, and the stars as a reflection of my personal, far-away dreams. 

I also think the everyday changes I experience as a person are pivotal to who I am, so I  wanted to incorporate elements that change in my portrait. The rectangles will flash the same colors, but slightly different; mirroring those mundane days of my life. Every time the page is refreshed, the stars will change positions and sizes,except for the constellation Orion. I used the constellation to represent the changes that have stayed with me on my journey.
