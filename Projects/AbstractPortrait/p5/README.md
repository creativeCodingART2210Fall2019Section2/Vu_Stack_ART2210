# Artist Statement


I see my self-portrait as largely unfinished; composed just with different fragments that make up who I am. 

For my abstract self-portrait I was initially influenced by the principles of the Bauhaus. Their process of breaking objects down into their simplest geometries helped me decide where I wanted to begin. Building upon this idea, a couple artists came to mind. 
Ryan Hewett's modern cubism style uses the literal human figure and fills it with abstract elements, much like our thoughts and experiences; things that make us who we are. The way that Christa Rijneveld fills the canvas with the scenery and stillness around her inspired me to use the mountains as a metaphor for my inner journey of self-exploration, and the stars as a reflection of my personal, far-away dreams. 

I also think the everyday changes I experience as a person are pivotal to who I am, so I  wanted to incorporate elements of that change in my portrait. The rectangles will flash the same colors, but slightly different; mirroring those mundane days of my life. Every time the page is refreshed, the stars will change positions and sizes,except for the constellation Orion. The changing stars represent the variables that fall in place in life that makes every day different. I used the constellation to represent the changes that have stayed with me on my journey.
